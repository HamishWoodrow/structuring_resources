# Document Processing

This folder of scripts deals with taking the set of 127 000 papers delivered from ARXIV and extracting:
- A document dictionary.
- Creating a TFIDF for the concept vectors of the documents.
- Using SVD methods to reduce the concept vector dimensionality and then to use a distance metric for evalutating documents similar to one another.
